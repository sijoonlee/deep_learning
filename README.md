**60 days of Udacity** was the part of **Secure and Private AI Facebook Scholarship Challenge**  
I barely knew what the deep learning is at the beginning of this summer, 2019.  
But after taking Secure and Private AI challenge in Udacity,  
now I feel comfortable with many of concepts and frameworks in Deep learning field.  
Below are course materials and practices that have been done in **60 days of Udacity**.  
Hopefully, some might find helpful links in [my log](https://github.com/sijoonlee/deep_learning/raw/master/60_days)

This is the part of **Secure and Private AI Nanodegree**.  
Yes, I got passed the Facebook scholarship challenge  
and taken into nanodegree program and graduated on 20, Nov, 2019.  
Notebooks from the course are organized in the repo.  


# [Spam-Ham Classification Model](https://github.com/sijoonlee/deep_learning/tree/master/Spam-Ham-Classfication)

I practiced PyTorch LSTM model with enron dataset to make Spam/Ham classifier.  
Based upon it, my walk-through article was publised on medium.
  
[This link](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/spam-ham-classification-using-lstm-in-pytorch-950daec94a7c) is my article published on medium  
[This link](https://github.com/sijoonlee/spam-ham-walkthrough) provides the code for the walkthrough
