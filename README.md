# Juphter notebooks from Udacity "Secure and Private AI" course 

These are my own practices for **"Secure and Private AI"** scholarship challenge course

All Jupyter Notebooks came from Udacity's repository:  
- [https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)
- [https://github.com/udacity/private-ai](https://github.com/udacity/private-ai)

to practice PyTorch, Panda and etc, basic knowledges and resourceful links were added into notebooks
