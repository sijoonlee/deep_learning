These are my own practices for **"Secure and Private AI"** scholarship challenge course

All Jupyter Notebooks came from Udacity's repository:

- [https://github.com/udacity/private-ai](https://github.com/udacity/private-ai)

to practice PyTorch, Panda and etc, basic knowledges and resourceful links were added into notebooks
