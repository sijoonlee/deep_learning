# 60 days of Udacity  

I barely knew what the deep learning is at the beginning of this summer, 2019.  
But after taking Secure and Private AI challenge in Udacity,  
now I feel comfortable with many of concepts and frameworks in Deep learning field.  
Below are course materials and practices that have been done in **60 days of Udacity**.  
Hopefully, some might find helpful links.

- The explanation about PATE in Udacity's course wasn't good enough for me  
- I have to look into the actual code to understand how it works
