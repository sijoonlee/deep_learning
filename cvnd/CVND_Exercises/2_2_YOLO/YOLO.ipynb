We detect the objects using the `detect_objects(m, resized_image, iou_thresh, nms_thresh)`function from the `utils` module.

Since we are running the algorithm on a CPU it takes about 2 seconds to detect the objects in an image, however, if we were to use a GPU it would run much faster.\n",

If you set the `plot_labels` flag to `False` you will display the bounding boxes with no labels. This makes it easier to view the bounding boxes if your `nms_thresh` is too low. The `plot_boxes()`function uses the same color to plot the bounding boxes of the same object class. However, if you want all bounding boxes to be the same color, you can use the `color` keyword to set the desired color. For example, if you want all the bounding boxes to be red you can use:\n",
